#### Descriptions

#####sKCF (Best real-time method VOT 2015)
> <b>Description</b>:  
 A fast Scalable Kernalized Correlation Filter framework [1]. The implementation allows the user to select between 15 algorithms combinations such as: gaussian, polynomial, and linear (sDCF) correlation filters. It also permits to select different features such as: RGB, HSV, HLS, GRAY (sCSK) color space and fast HOG descriptors. It allows to implement different strategies for its scale estimation step, add more features and/or correlation filters.

#####KCF
> <b>Description</b>:  
 This package includes a C++ class with several tracking methods based on the Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF)[2,3]. Three algorithms are implemented. First, KCF on HOG features, ported to C++ OpenCV. The original Matlab tracker placed 3rd in VOT 2014. Second, KCF on HOG and Lab features, ported to C++ OpenCV. The Lab features are computed by quantizing CIE-Lab colors into 15 centroids, obtained from natural images by k-means. Finally, the CSK tracker [2] is also implemented by using raw grayscale as features.

#####OpenTLD
> <b>Description</b>:  
  C++ implementation of OpenTLD that was originally published in MATLAB by Zdenek Kalal. OpenTLD is used for tracking objects in video streams. This implementation is based solely on open source libraries, meaning that you do not need any commercial products to compile or run it.
