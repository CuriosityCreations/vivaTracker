## Welcome to vivaTracker

This project contains a collection of visual tracking algorithms implemented in C++ and/or C. 
The idea of the project is to help you create, unify and publish your visual tracking algorithms with other developers. 
We also include public tracking datasets for easy integration and analysis of the algorithms. 


This project does **NOT** evaluate and compare tracking methods. Many benchmarks with different evaluation methodologies for tracking algorithms are public available.
Among the most relevant benchmarks you could find the [Visual Tracker Benchmark](https://sites.google.com/site/trackerbenchmark/benchmarks/v10) and the [VOT Challenges](http://www.votchallenge.net).
We are just interested in collecting and publishing tracking algorithm implementations.
This way, researches and developers can learn, compare and execute the different methods on their own sequences or existing datasets. 
 
We provide a cross-platform framework for easy algorithm integration and execution on annotated datasets. The project uses cmake system generator to facilitate the development and testing of the algorithms in your own platform/IDE.

Currently, the project incorporates some tracking algorithms (i.e., sKCF, KCF, STRUCK, OpenTLD, and NCC) and all the VOT Challenge datasets.

The **vivaTracker** framework is a C++11 cross-platform project to create, compare and test object tracking algorithms using OpenCV 3.x.x. 

Enclosed in this project you will also find the **vivalib**  and **trackerlib** libraries.
The **vivaTracker** project uses concurrent [**vivalib**](https://github.com/asolis/vivaVideo/wiki) 
to process sequences (i.e., video files, web files, image sequences, etc...) while displaying and generating video outputs of your algorithm. 

The **trackerlib** allows simple integration and unifies multiple tracking implementations under the same framework.  
The **trackerlib** sits on top of the **vivalib** to allow access to annotated datasets for object tracking (e.g., VOT datasets) while allowing 
the use of your own dataset or image sequences.
